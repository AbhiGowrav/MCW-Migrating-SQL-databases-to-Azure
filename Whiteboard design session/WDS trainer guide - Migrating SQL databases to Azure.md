# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements.

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture.

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers.

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution.

- Respond to customer objections.

- Receive feedback.

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution.

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Migrating SQL databases to Azure whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you work in a group to develop a plan for migrating on-premises VMs and SQL Server 2008 R2 databases into a combination of IaaS and PaaS services in Azure. You provide guidance on performing assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the customer's SQL Server 2008 R2 databases and the managed database offerings in Azure. You then design a solution for migrating their on-premises services, including VMs and databases, into Azure, with minimal or no down-time. Finally, you provide guidance on how to enable some of the advanced SQL features available in Azure to improve security and performance in the customer's applications.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Tailspin Toys is the developer of several popular online video games. Founded in 2010, the company has experienced exponential growth since releasing the first installment of their most popular game franchise to include online multiplayer gameplay. They have since built upon this success by adding online capabilities to the majority of their game portfolio.

To facilitate online gameplay, they decided to take a conservative approach, hosting the gaming services on-premises using rented hardware. This approach allowed them to enter the online gaming market with a minimal upfront investment and lower risk. For each game, their gaming services setup consists of three virtual machines running the gaming software and five game databases hosted on a single SQL Server 2008 R2 Enterprise instance. They are using the Service Broker feature of SQL Server for sending messages between gaming databases. In addition to the dedicated gaming VMs and databases, their gaming services include authentication and gateway VMs and databases, which are shared across all their games.

Molly Fischer, the CIO of Tailspin Toys, stated that the response to adding online gameplay has far exceeded their initial estimates. While the increased popularity of their games has been good for profitability, the rapid increase in demand for their services has made supporting the current setup problematic. At its foundation, Tailspin Toys is a game development company, made up primarily of software developers. The few dedicated database and infrastructure resources they do have are struggling to keep up with an ever-expanding workload. Increasingly, game developers have had to step in to assist in supporting the infrastructure, which is taking time away from game development and has resulted in several missed release timelines. Molly has expressed concerns over adding additional non-developer resources, as she feels this is outside of their core business. She is hoping that migrating their services from on-premises to the cloud can help to alleviate some of their infrastructure management issues, while simultaneously helping them to refocus their efforts on delivering business value by releasing new and improved games.

Compounding this problem is the release schedule for new versions of their most popular games. They have a target schedule of releasing a new version every 12 - 18 months, which means adding new VMs and a database server for each new version they release, while also maintaining the services for all previous game versions. Each new release results in increased rental equipment costs, as well as a steadily increasing workload on their already overburdened staff. Internally, they have discussed end-of-life scenarios for older game versions, but the number of players remains high for many of their older games, so no decisions have been made about when to end support for those games.

Tailspin Toys indicated that their current hardware rental agreement ends in three months, and they're hoping to avoid signing another contract by migrating their existing VMs into Azure. They understand three months is a short timeframe, but believe a lift-and-shift approach of their gaming service VMs might be possible if they dedicate the appropriate resources. They already have VM images for each of their games that could be used in the process. They would like to know more about what a lift-and-shift might involve so they can plan resource allocation accordingly. They are also interested in learning more if this approach could be used to allow them to better scale the VM and database deployments on a per-game basis. Currently, they use the same number of VMs and databases for each game and version but have frequently run into issues hosting more gamers for popular games. They would like the ability to scale up to meet demand on new releases and more popular games, while also being able to scale down for older and less popular games. They would also like to investigate the possibility of globally distributing their gaming services to address latency issues reported by gamers accessing their services from other locations around the world.

Of great concern to the leadership team at Tailspin Toys is the rapidly approaching end of support date for SQL Server 2008 R2. For their databases, they are interested in hearing more about fully-managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) options in Azure. They lack any employees with actual database administration skills, so they feel this would be an excellent first step towards reducing their infrastructure workload. They have requested assistance in assessing any compatibility issues between their current databases and PaaS options in Azure. They have read that the Service Broker feature of SQL Server is not available in Azure. They are using this functionality for several critical gaming processes, and cannot afford to lose this capability when migrating their gaming databases to the cloud. They have also stated that, at this time, they do not have the resources to rearchitect the gaming services to use an alternative message broker.

In addition to their gaming services, Tailspin Toys is also interested in migrating their data warehouse and its associated services to the cloud. They currently host their data warehouse on a dedicated SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. The data warehouse is currently around 20TB in size and is growing at a rate of about 250GB per month. They collect numerous game telemetry data points, including remote monitoring and analysis of game servers and user telemetry (i.e., data on the behavior of players, such as their interaction with games and with other players). Code embedded in the gaming software transmits data to the gaming databases. That telemetry data is loaded hourly using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages. Using the data in their data warehouse, they build SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cubes and create reports using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). The SSRS reports are deployed to sites in their SharePoint environment. They also noted that their customer service personnel and developers connect to the data warehouse for various activities.

They also mentioned that they have some reports that are run directly against the gaming databases so that they can analyze real-time user telemetry and gaming metrics. While there are not many of these reports, they are important to the developers and business users. They have noticed that at times of peak gaming activity, running these reports can be very slow, and they have occasionally seen impacts on gaming performance. They are interested to learn if there is any way they can continue to run these reports, but do it in a way that will alleviate the performance impact they've experienced.

Tailspin Toys is excited to learn more about how migrating to the cloud can help them improve their overall processes, as well as address the concerns and issues they have with their on-premises setup. They are looking for a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating their gaming VMs and databases into the cloud. Their end goal is to migrate their whole service to the cloud, so they would also like to understand better what their overall architecture might look after migrating to the cloud.

To assist you in better understanding their current environment, Tailspin Toys has provided the following architecture diagram of their on-premises gaming services implementation.

![Current architecture diagram.](media/current-architecture.png "Current architecture")

### Customer needs

1. We want to migrate all our gaming services infrastructure into the cloud, using PaaS services where possible. We would like to know if this can be accomplished in three months to avoid renewing our equipment rental contract.

2. In addition to our gaming services, we would like to migrate our existing data warehouse to Azure to take advantage of the ability to scale out along with some new SQL features available there. As part of this request, we would like to know more about:

    - Adding the ability to scale out the data warehouse to serve more requests.
    - The upgrade path for our SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and SSRS reports.

3. We want recommendations for how to minimize migration costs as much as possible.

4. We want to improve the security posture of our databases and learn more about potential vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

5. We have had complaints of high latency from gamers in other regions throughout the world, along with reports that gamers are unable to join games during peaks of high usage. By migrating our gaming services to the cloud, we are looking to improve the overall gaming experience, including:

   - Reducing latency for gamers accessing our services from various places around the world.
   - Improving our ability to host more gamers during peak times or when new game releases.
   - Adding redundancy to ensure high-availability for our gaming services.

6. In the event of a regional outage, we would like to be able to resume gaming services within minutes and recover the data warehouse within 48 hours.

### Customer objections

1. It appears that there are multiple options for hosting SQL databases in Azure. What are all the different options, and how do they differ? Do they all support the same features as an on-premises SQL Server instance, or are there unsupported features we should be aware of before migrating? Will we be able to continue using Service Broker with a PaaS database in Azure?

2. Are there tools that allow us to evaluate which of the various SQL Database hosting options in Azure will work with our current SQL Server 2008 R2 databases? Is there a way we can test targeted workloads against other versions of SQL? Are there tools that can help us identify potential issues and incompatibilities before we attempt a migration?

3. In moving to the cloud, will we retain the ability to connect to and troubleshoot from our on-premises dev environment, while keeping our back-end networking fully isolated and only enabling talking to the front-end through a secured channel?

4. We do not want to be locked into a specific cloud vendor. Is it possible to use PaaS services for hosting our databases, and still have a valid exit strategy, or will this mean we should stick to using VMs in Azure for hosting our databases?

- For the first round, assign one table as the presenting team and the other table as the customer.

- Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team.

  - Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to.

  - The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes.

  - If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

- Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred target audience

Molly Fischer, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Tailspin Toys

The primary audience is business and technology decision-makers. From the case study scenario, it would include the Director of Analytics. Usually, we talk to the infrastructure managers who report to the chief information officer (CIO), or to application sponsors, such as a line of business (LOB) vice president (VP), chief marketing officer (CMO), or to those who represent the business unit IT or developers who report to application sponsors.

## Preferred solution

*High-level architecture*

1. Without getting into the details (the following sections address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for the game databases, gaming services VMs, data warehouse, and associated services. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

    After running the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant assessments against their gaming databases, Tailspin Toys found that Azure SQL Database Managed Instance would allow them to host their databases in a fully-managed Azure PaaS service, with no required changes to their databases. This can help to shift their focus back to game development, and not have to spend as much time worrying about administering databases. To minimize downtime, they decided to use the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration capabilities.

    ![Possible target architecture](media/target-architecture.png "Target architecture")

    From a high level, their authentication and gateway services VMs will be migrated into Azure VMs, doing a simple lift-and-shift. The two back-end authentication databases will be migrated to a single Azure SQL MI General purpose service tier. Authentication services will be shared among games within the same region. Their gaming software VMs will be migrated to Azure VMs and associated with a single SQL MI instance running the five gaming databases. This setup will be repeated for each game. The game and authentication databases will be migrated using the Azure Database Migration Service.

    In more detail, for each game, an isolated VNet will be created, with subnets for the game service, managed instances, authorization services, management, and a Gateway subnet, as displayed in the diagram below.

    ![A detailed diagram of the target gaming services architecture is displayed. The resources are broken down into subnets within an isolated VNet. This setup would be used for each game.](media/target-architecture-gaming-services.png "Gaming services architecture")

    Their data warehouse will be migrated to Azure SQL Database Hyperscale, to accommodate the large amount of data they currently have, in addition to facilitating serving more requests. Movement of telemetry data from the gaming databases into the data warehouse will be handled using the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory (ADF). Data can be scheduled to run hourly in ADF, just as it was with their existing SSIS packages. From the data warehouse, Azure Analysis Services (Azure AS) will be used for data modeling in the cloud. SSRS currently has no direct cloud-based equivalent, so the customer's reports will be rewritten using Microsoft Power BI. Reports will be sent to SharePoint running on an Azure VM, backed by another SQL MI General-purpose instance.

    On-premises users, developers, and customer services personnel, will be able to connect to the resources in Azure using an ExpressRoute connection or VNet peering, for troubleshooting and accessing reports.

    *The preferred solution is just one of many viable options.*

2. How can migration costs be minimized?

    *Azure Hybrid Benefit*

    Reduce the burden of data-tier management and save time and costs by migrating workloads to the cloud.

    The [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) for SQL Server will provide a cost-effective path for migrating their SQL Server databases to Azure with minimal effort. It allows them to use their existing SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance to pay a reduced rate when migrating to the cloud. Tailspin Toys could save up to 55 percent by taking advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit.

    *Prepay for reserved capacity*

    It is also recommended that the customer prepay for compute resources with [reserved capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-reserved-capacity) to save compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With Azure SQL Database reserved capacity, they would make an upfront commitment on SQL Database for a period of one or three years to get a significant discount on the compute costs, which could save them up to 80 percent.

    *Azure Database Migration Service*

    [Azure Database Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview) can be used to reduce the cost and complexity of their cloud migration by providing a single comprehensive service instead of multiple tools.

3. Is it possible to migrate Tailspin's gaming services within three months?

    While there are no guarantees that the complete migration could be completed in a three-month window, there are steps Tailspin Toys could take and tools they could use to improve their chances of success.

    Using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) can help simplify the process of database migration. For their gaming and authentication databases, DMS provides a simple tool for migrating a large number of databases into Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, with minimal time and effort. Using SQL MI will also help to minimize the number of application and database changes needed to get up and running the cloud quickly. This could be used to migrate their database while remaining online, which will cut down on time required to prepare and manage the cutover to online services. DMS could also be used to handle the migration of the data warehouse into Azure SQL DB Hyperscale.

    Azure Site Recovery (ASR) could be used to replicate their on-premises VMs into Azure VMs, quickly and easily. It is designed for business continuity and disaster recovery, but can also be used to manage replication for on-premises VMs into Azure.

    The Tailspin Toys team would need to have dedicated resources assigned to the migration project. They would also benefit from bringing in a Microsoft partner with experience in performing large cloud migrations to help speed up the process and improve their chances of meeting such a tight timeline.

4. What functionality should you include in the PoC?

    For the PoC, we should include the following:

    - All assets required for a hosting a single game in Azure:

      - Authentication and gateway services:
        - VMs should be hosted on Azure virtual machines.
        - The two authentication databases should be hosted on a single SQL MI General Purpose tier instance.
      - The five gaming databases hosted on a single SQL MI Business Critical tier instance.
      - The three gaming services virtual machines migrated to Azure VMs.

    - An upgraded data warehouse:

      - Hosted on Azure SQL DB Hyperscale, to accommodate the size of the database and number of users connecting.
      - Upgraded SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS.
      - Implement new features in Azure SQL DB, such as table compression, Transparent Data Encryption, and Clustered ColumnStore Indexing.

    - VNet isolation:

      - Inherent with SQL MI.
      - Management subnet for managing the databases.
      - Gaming services VNet for hosting gaming services VMs, with VNet peering back to SQL MI VNet.
      - Secure channel for connecting to the databases from on-premises development machines for troubleshooting.

*Game databases*

1. What are the factors that Tailspin Toys should consider when deciding between PaaS or IaaS options for hosting their SQL databases in Azure?

    Several factors should help drive their decision to choose PaaS or IaaS for hosting their SQL databases in Azure:

    - **Cost**: Both PaaS and IaaS options include a base price that covers underlying infrastructure and licensing. However, with the IaaS option, they would need to invest additional time and resources for the management of databases, while with PaaS, many administration features are included in the price.

    - **Administration**: PaaS options will reduce the amount of time they need to spend administering databases. However, it also limits the range of custom administration tasks and scripts they will be able to perform or run.

    - **Service-Level Agreement**: Both IaaS and PaaS provide high, industry-standard SLAs. The PaaS option guarantees a 99.99% SLA. IaaS guarantees a 99.95% SLA for infrastructure, meaning they may need to implement additional mechanisms to ensure the availability of their databases.

    - **Time to move to Azure**: SQL Server on an Azure VM will be an exact match of their environment, so migration from on-premises to Azure SQL VMs would be no different than moving their on-premises databases to another on-premises database server. SQL Managed Instance also enables straightforward migration. However, there might be some changes that they would need to apply before they can migrate to a managed instance. SQL DB can be a good target, but there are more feature and compatibility concerns, so this could be the slowest option, depending on the on-premises databases.

2. From the options for hosting SQL databases in Azure, which would you recommend for hosting their gaming databases, and why do you think that the best choice? What pricing tier would you recommend?

    The recommended option for hosting their gaming databases in Azure is to use Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in the Business Critical service tier.

    The customer expressed the desire to use a PaaS offering, if possible, and SQL MI provides a fully-managed platform, with the benefits of a PaaS database service. In combination with the Database Migration Service, it provides a simple way to migrate their databases into Azure, with little to no downtime. Given the customer's large number of databases, along with the use of the Service broker feature, SQL MI provides an optimum solution, while also helping to reduce the cost and managed overhead that could be associated with using SQL Server on VMs. The use of Service broker will prevent them from using SQL DB without first making changes to the database architecture. Also, SQL MI provides the VNet isolation and added security the customer has requested.

    The customer has stated clearly that they do not have the infrastructure or database resources required to support their existing structure, and that they do not wish to add more resources with those skills to the team. Their desire to reduce the amount of infrastructure they are managing, as well as reducing costs, moves the decision away from SQL on VMs.

    The Business Critical service tier is designed for applications that require the highest performance and HA requirements. Given the nature of the gaming applications and databases, the customer should use the service tier that provides them with the lowest IO latency, highest availability, and best performance possible. The inclusion of a built-in read-only replica could also help take some workload of the primary databases for reporting and read-only workloads, at no additional cost.

3. How would you handle the data migration? Provide step-by-step instructions from assessment to data migration.

    Data migration should be handled using the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration capabilities, which meets the customer's requirement of minimal downtime. Data platform migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project, meaning a robust methodology is required for success.

    In planning their migration project, they should consider the process similar to that shown in the following graphic:

    ![Diagram providing an overview of the data platform migration process.](media/data-platform-migration-process.png "Data Platform Migration")

    *Pre-migration*:

    - **Discover**: Inventory your source database assets and perform an application stack discovery.
    - **Assess**: Assess source workloads and fix recommendations.
    - **Convert**: Convert the source schema to work in the target environment. This is only relevant for heterogeneous migrations.

    *Migration*:

    - **Migrate schema, data, and objects**: Migrate the source schema and then migrate the source data to the target.
    - **Sync data**: Sync your target schema and data with the source. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.
    - **Cutover**: Cutover from the source to the target environment. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.

    *Post-migration*:

    - **Remediate applications**: Iteratively make any necessary changes to your applications.
    - **Perform Tests**: Iteratively run functional and performance tests.
    - **Optimize**: Based on the tests you performed, address any performance issues, and then retest to confirm the performance improvements.

4. What are some of the features available in Azure SQL Database Managed Instance that can help improve the security posture of Tailspin Toys?

    SQL MI includes numerous security tools that could be leveraged by Tailspin Toys, including:

    - [SQL Database Advance Data Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) (ADS) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for discovering and classifying sensitive data, surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate threats to databases.

    - The [SQL Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification?view=sql-server-2017) feature of ADS is a new tool for discovering, classifying, labeling & reporting the sensitive data in databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in databases, not just the database.

    - The [SQL Vulnerability Assessment service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment) provides visibility into the security state of a database and includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance database security.

    - [Advanced Threat Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-overview) for Azure SQL Database Managed Instance detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.

    - [Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql) encrypts data at rest. This will help protect them from the potential of malicious parties being able to obtain data from physical media, such as drives or backup tapes.

    - [Dynamic Data Masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It is a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

    - [Row-level security](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/row-level-security) enables you to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user executing a query (such as by group membership or execution context). Row-level security (RLS) simplifies the design and coding of security in your application. RLS enables you to implement restrictions on data row access. For example, ensuring that workers can access only the data rows that are pertinent to their department or restricting data access to only the relevant data.

5. Are there features of a PaaS database service that could help to reduce the impact of read-only reports running directly against their gaming databases?

    Each database in the SQL MI Business Critical tier is automatically provisioned with several AlwaysON replicas to support the availability SLA. This provides a capability called [**Read Scale-Out**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out), which enables the load balancing of read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica. Using Read Scale-Out means read-only workloads can be isolated from the primary read-write workload without affecting its performance.

    The feature is intended for applications that include logically separated read-only workloads, such as analytics, and therefore they could gain performance benefits using this additional capacity at no extra cost.

*Gaming services*

1. How should Tailspin Toys handle migrating their gaming services VMs into Azure?

    They should consider using Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to replicate their on-premises VMs into Azure VMs, quickly and easily. It is designed for business continuity and disaster recovery, but can also be used to manage replication for on-premises VMs into Azure.

2. What would you recommend for addressing the latency issues experienced by gamers from other regions of the world?

    To address the latency issues reported by gamers, they should look at deploying their services to multiple regions around the globe. By deploying closer to where gamers are, they can reduce the latency they experience when accessing the online gaming services.

3. How should the ability to scale gaming services up or down be handled?

    Scaling occurs on two levels for the gaming services, one for VMs and another for databases.

    First, for the gaming software virtual machines, they should consider using VM scale sets for each game. This allows them to create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs, the number of which can be automatically increased or decreased in response to demand or a defined schedule.

    For the databases, the number of vCores assigned to the managed instance can be increased or decreased. However, this is not an automatic process and can be slow and potentially cause downtime. Another option is to add another managed instance and distribute the workload among more instances.

4. How can the gaming services be made highly-available?

    Virtual machine scale sets can be used to provide high-availability for the gaming software and authentication VMs. To protect against data center failures, they could also create scale sets that use Availability Zones.

    Azure SQL Database Managed Instance comes with built-in high-availability. Transactional replication could be used to keep data in sync between multiple regions.

*Data warehouse and reporting*

1. What would you recommend as the target platform for their data warehouse in Azure?

    For their data warehouse, they could use either Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure SQL Database (Hyperscale service tier). The Hyperscale service tier is required due to the large size of its existing data warehouse.

    Given the customer's requirements, migrating to Azure SQL Database Hyperscale service tier is the recommended approach. This would provide maximum compatibility with their existing SQL Server 2008 R2 data warehouse, without needing to make any architectural changes. With the customer's current lack of real DBA skills, this would simplify the migration. Migrating to Azure Synapse Analytics, on the other hand, could require some re-architecting. In addition, the customer stated that their developers and customer service personnel connect directly to the data warehouse for reporting, troubleshooting, and other activities. Azure Synapse Analytics allows a maximum of four to 128 concurrent queries, depending on the service level selected, so this could cause issues if many users are hitting the data warehouse concurrently.

2. How could they read-scale out their data warehouse to serve more requests?

    The Hyperscale service tier is a highly scalable storage and compute performance tier that leverages the Azure architecture to scale out the storage and compute resources for an Azure SQL Database substantially beyond the limits available for the General Purpose and Business Critical service tiers.

    SQL DB Hyperscale provides the ability to scale both out and up rapidly. Scaling out involves provisioning one or more read-only nodes for offloading read-only workloads and for use as hot-standbys. Read Scale-Out uses the `ApplicationIntent` argument in the connection string to direct requests to a read-only secondary replica of the Hyperscale database. Scaling up involves scaling up compute resources to accommodate heavy workloads, and then scaling back down when the additional resources are not needed.

3. What is the upgrade path for their SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and SSRS reports?

    ![Diagram of the upgrade/replacement path for SQL Server Services, showing SSIS going to Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory, SSAS going to Azure Analysis Services, and SSRS going to Power BI.](media/sql-services-upgrade-path.png "SQL Services (SSxS) upgrade paths")

    *SSIS*

    SSIS will be replaced with the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory. Typically, SSIS packages can be moved into ADF using a simple lift-and-shift approach using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to deploy and run the SSIS packages.

    Alternatively, SSIS could be deployed using SQL Server on an Azure VM.

    *SSAS cubes*

    Azure Analysis Services (Azure AS) is a PaaS version of SSAS on-premises. Tabular models can be migrated from SSAS to Azure AS using Visual Studio.

    Alternatively, SSAS could be deployed using SQL Server on an Azure VM.

    *SSRS*

    There isn't a PaaS equivalent of SSRS, so they would either need to run SSRS on an Azure VM (IaaS) or rewrite their reports around Microsoft Power BI reporting capabilities.

*Regional outages*

1. How can their gaming services be recovered within the specified RTO/RPO?

    To protect against data center failures and regional outages, they should use Availability Zones for their virtual machines. Availability Zones will allow them to spread their VMs across as many as five regions, helping to reduce the likelihood of a complete outage.

    For their gaming databases, they should configure auto-failover groups for the Azure SQL Database Managed Instances. By using auto-failover groups with an automatic failover policy, any outage that impacts one or several of the databases in the group results in automatic failover. In addition, auto-failover groups provide read-write and read-only listener endpoints that remain unchanged during fail-overs. Whether you use manual or automatic failover activation, failover switches all secondary databases in the group to the primary. After the database failover is completed, the DNS record is automatically updated to redirect the endpoints to the new region.

    > **Note**: Auto-failover groups for Managed Instance is currently in public preview. For customers who object to using a *preview* feature, a manual failover process would need to be implemented. This could involve setting up transactional replication to another SQL MI in a different region. VNet peering would need to be established between the virtual networks.

    For their data warehouse, they should use the geo-restore recovery pattern to achieve the lowest possible RTO and RPO. They would use geo-restore to recover the catalog and tenant databases from automatically maintained geo-redundant backups into an alternate recovery region. After the outage is resolved, they would use geo-replication to repatriate changed databases to their original region.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. It appears that there are multiple options for hosting SQL databases in Azure. What are all the different options, and how do they differ? Do they all support the same features as an on-premises SQL Server instance, or are there unsupported features we should be aware of before migrating?

    There are indeed multiple options for hosting SQL databases in Azure. The options have some overlap, but each is geared towards specific use cases and scenarios, as described below.

    *Azure SQL Database (SQL DB)*

    SQL DB is a fully-managed general-purpose relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) platform in Azure. Built on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine, it provides a high-performance, easy-to-use, reliable, and secure database that you can use without needing to manage infrastructure. It is available as a single database or an elastic pool, which is a collection of databases with a shared set of resources.

    SQL DB has additional features that are not available in on-premises SQL Server, such as built-in high-availability, intelligence, and management. It also provides options to quickly and easily scale up or out for greater power with no interruption.

    Architecturally, Azure SQL DB uses an isolated multi-tenant model and needs to share physical resources among all clients of the service. As such, server-level functionality is generally restricted or unsupported. Tools such as SQL Server Utility, SQL Trace, Profiler, and many system tables no longer apply and are not available. In their place, several views are available to provide diagnostic and health monitoring.

    Due to the architectural differences, there are also some features of SQL Server that are different or unsupported in SQL DB. Differences include Transact SQL (T-SQL) differences, such as data types, functions, operators, statements, procedures, and system tables and views that are not supported. Unsupported features include distributed transactions, SQL Agent jobs, .NET CLR integration, Filestream, extended stored procedures, and Service broker.

    Azure SQL DB is best for new cloud-native applications or existing applications that want to use the latest stable SQL Server features. Also, it is recommended for teams that do not want to employ resources for configuration and management of database infrastructure.

    *Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI)*

    SQL MI is a fully-managed PaaS SQL Server Database Engine Instance hosted in Azure that provides *near* 100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server database instances. Unlike SQL DB, it does not use an isolated multi-tenant model but instead provides a native virtual network (VNet) implementation that addresses many common isolation and security concerns of on-premises SQL Server customers. As such, it is the best PaaS option for migrating existing SQL Server databases to the cloud.

    The managed instance model allows existing SQL Server customers to lift-and-shift their on-premises applications to the cloud with minimal application and database changes. As a deployment option of Azure SQL Database, it preserves all the PaaS capabilities that drastically reduce management overhead and TCO. While the majority of on-premises SQL features are supported, there are some features, like Filestream, that are not available. Unlike SQL DB, SQL MI does support distributed transactions, SQL Agent jobs, .NET CLR integration, and Service broker.

    Azure SQL MI is best for new cloud-native applications or existing applications that want to use the latest stable SQL Server features, and need to be migrated to the cloud with minimal changes. In addition, it is recommended for teams that do not want to employ resources for configuration and management of database infrastructure.

    *SQL Server on an Azure VM*

    Running SQL Server on Azure VMs is an IaaS approach that would allow a 100% compatible transition of existing databases to the cloud, without any need for application changes. It works with any SQL Server version and edition on any machine size, on both Windows and Linux. SQL Server on an Azure VM provides a seamless, no-hassle method for moving SQL Server workloads from on-premises to the cloud. Teams will be freed from needing to manage on-premises hardware, but it does require teams to continue to manage the underlying infrastructure, including OS, database, and application patching. This option can also be more expensive with multiple databases and is more difficult to scale. High availability would come from using SQL Server Availability Groups.

    SQL Server on Azure VMs is a good choice when full control over the database is required, or when the source database uses features that are not supported in Azure SQL DB and SQL MI, such as filestream and file groups. This approach recommended for teams that need to choose maintenance and patching schedules that work best for their business operations. In addition, for customers running SQL Server 2008 R2, migrating their database to Azure VMs does provide an additional three years of support beyond the July 2019 end of support cutoff.

2. Are there tools that allow us to evaluate which of the various SQL Database hosting options in Azure will work with our current SQL Server 2008 R2 databases? Is there a way we can test targeted workloads against other versions of SQL? Are there tools that can help us identify potential issues and incompatibilities before we attempt a migration?

    Microsoft provides multiple tools for assisting with cloud migrations and upgrades of databases.

    *Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA)*

    The Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) is an A/B testing solution for SQL Server upgrades. It will assist in evaluating specific workloads against a targeted version of SQL Server or SQL Database. DEA is not a migration tool but can be used to help determine the appropriate target version of SQL Server or SQL Database for migrations.

    DEA guides you through running A/B testing by completing three steps:

    - **Capture**: The first step of SQL Server A/B testing is to capture a trace on your source server. Trace files capture the entire query workload on that server.
    - **Replay**: The second step of SQL Server A/B testing is to replay the trace file that was captured on your target servers, and then collect extensive traces from the replay for analysis.
    - **Analysis**: The final step is to generate an analysis report by using the replay traces. The analysis report can help you gain insight into the implications of the proposed change.

    Using the analysis metrics provided by DEA, customers who are upgrading from an earlier version of SQL Server (starting with 2005) to a more recent version can identify compatibility errors, degraded queries and query plans, and other workload comparison data. The comparison data can lead to higher confidence and a more successful upgrade experience.

    *Database Migration Assistant (DMA)*

    The Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility and feature parity issues that can impact an upgrade or migration to your target version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA also provides recommendations on performance and reliability improvements you can make once your databases have been migrated to your target environment. It allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects (SQL Agent jobs, SSIS packages, roles, users, and logins) from your source server to your target server.

    *Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)*

    The Azure Database Migration Service is a fully managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure Data platforms with minimal downtime. It provides customers with a comprehensive, highly available migration solution. The service uses the Data Migration Assistant to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to guide you through the changes required prior to performing a migration. When you're ready to begin the migration process, the Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps, following best practices as determined by Microsoft.

    In addition to SQL database migrations, DMS can also be used for migrating other database types, such as MongoDB to Cosmos DB and MySQL and PostgreSQL migrations to the Azure Data Platform.

    *SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)*

    While not specifically applicable to this scenario, another tool to be aware of is the SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA). SSMA is a tool designed to automate database migrations to SQL Server or SQL Database from Microsoft Access, DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and SAP ASE.

3. In moving to the cloud, will we retain the ability to connect to and troubleshoot from our on-premises dev environment, while keeping our back-end networking fully isolated and only enabling talking to the front-end through a secured channel?

    Yes, this is still possible after migrating your databases and applications to the cloud.

    Azure SQL Database Managed Instance provides full VNet isolation. It is placed inside an Azure virtual network and in a subnet that is dedicated to managed instances. It is accessible via a secure private IP address to allow connectivity from inside its virtual network.

    Management and deployment services connect to a managed instance by using a management endpoint that maps to an external load balancer. Traffic is routed to the nodes only if it is received on a predefined set of ports that only the managed instance's management components use. A built-in firewall on the nodes is set up to allow traffic only from Microsoft IP ranges. Certificates mutually authenticate all communication between management components and the management plane.

    Customer applications can connect to managed instances and can query and update databases inside the virtual network, peered virtual network, or network connected by VPN or Azure ExpressRoute. This network must use an endpoint and a private IP address.

    To reduce some of the complexity of connecting to SQL MI, it is also possible to access SQL MI through a secure public endpoint. SQL MI has a dedicated public endpoint address, which is disabled by default. If enabled, the client-side outbound firewall and network security group rules limit outbound connectivity to this endpoint. It is recommended that the traffic allowed to connect be limited to well-known IP addresses.

4. We do not want to be locked into a specific cloud vendor. Is it possible to use PaaS services for hosting our databases, and still have a valid exit strategy, or will this mean we should stick to using VMs in Azure for hosting our databases?

    Yes, it is possible to use a PaaS database service and still avoid vendor lock-in. They could use [Transactional replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/replication-with-sql-database-managed-instance) to replicate data into remote SQL Server databases, including those in another cloud vendor's cloud.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"With Azure SQL Database Managed Instance and the Azure Database Migration Service, we were able to migrate our database workloads into the cloud with minimal downtime. With SQL MI, we have found a reliable, fully-managed cloud database that allows us to focus our efforts on adding business value, without having to worry about maintaining the underlying server hardware and operating systems."
